** TODO Limit rate of NEURON integration/simulation

NEURON simulation cannot be too fast for user to interact meaningfully with the cell.
A good example for controlling the rate can be found [[https://github.com/bcumming/nbench/blob/master/benchmarks/bench_cell/neuron/bench.mod][here]]

Make the integration rate variable controllable using NEURON-sockets so user can speed up & slow down simulatin in Conductor GUI.
